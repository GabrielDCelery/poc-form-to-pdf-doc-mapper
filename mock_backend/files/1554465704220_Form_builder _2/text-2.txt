2. INITIALIZATION The form builder is bundled and minified javascript code that takes in a configuration  (provided by you) and uses it to do it’s “magic” under the hood. In order to make it part  of the form you have to navigate to the dynamic form configuration and copy-paste it to  the “Embedded assets – Javascript” section. In the example shown in this quick tutorial the form is a skinny version of a sublease  submission, where there are three Targets. Doctors, Stores and the Sublease (which is the Relational Target). IMPORTANT! Make sure you copy-paste the entire code. If anything is missing or you modify the code  the form builder will not work. Save the settings and if you open the dynamic form you should see the form builder  being initialized and applying the default styling and layout. P a g e  | 2
