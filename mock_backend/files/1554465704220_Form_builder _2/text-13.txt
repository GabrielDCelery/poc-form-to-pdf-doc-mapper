5.0 GROUPING FIELDS TOGETHER Now let’s do something a little bit more advanced. The form builder allows us to put fields into logical groups (or nest groups within groups). This will give us access to powerful  features like pagination, or showing/hiding multiple fields at once. If you remember here in this tutorial we have three Targets. Doctors, Stores and the  Sublease (which is the Relational Target). This setting on the surface will not change the form, but under the hood quite a few  things happened. We told the form builder that we have five groups, “sublease”,  “doctor”, “store”, “store-address” and “doctor-corporation”. Two of which are nested  groups. We also defined which fields belong to which group by using their ids. IMPORTANT! When you define groups you have to allocate all the fields, otherwise they will “fall out”  from the form.
