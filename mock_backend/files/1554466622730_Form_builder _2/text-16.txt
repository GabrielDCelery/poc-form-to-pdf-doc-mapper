6.0. CHANGING COLOURS Now that we added some content and our form started taking shape we can see that by  default ther form builder uses variations of grey and black to colour the form. The grey is  the primary and the black is the secondary by default. If we want to change that we only  have to do the following. After defining the primary and secondary colours all of that gets applied to all the  elements throughout the form to get the following result. IMPORTANT! When it comes to text the form builder runs a check against the background colour and  picks white or black dependent on which one is the most contrasting. P a g e  | 16
