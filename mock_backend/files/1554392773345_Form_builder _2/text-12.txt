4.6 ADVANCED FIELD CONFIGURATION Now lets stop here for a moment. In the above examples we were able to add quick  changes, but soon we would run into certain limitations. What if we wanted to add more  rows to textarea fields, what if we wanted to date field to use US rather than UK locale  date. What about adding hyperlinks to helper texts? The form builder allows you to do “finer” configuration. Take a look at the configurations  below. These two configurations provide the same result. The difference is that this time we  provided “sub-configuration objects” instead of simple texts. You will learn more about  that in the advanced section, but for now all you have to know that this is the way to do  things, like injecting HTML content to the form. P a g e  | 12
