4.2. CHANGING FIELD LABELS Modifying fields, like changing the label, adding a placeholder, or just changing the field  type is quite a common task. The form builder gives you quick access through the  configuration to do all of these. First, let’s change the label for individual fields. And if you want to add the same label to several fields at once you only have to do the  following. IMPORTANT! As you can see you target single fields by using the “single” property and multiple fields  at once with the “multiple” property. Single fields: First you tell the form builder which field you want to modify (using its id) and then you  tell it what logic apply to the field. Multiple fields: First you tell the form builder what is the logic you want to apply, then you list the fields  you want the logic to be applied to. P a g e  | 5
